# Brematic.Net
This project offers a home for controlling your remote power outlets (and potentially other stuff) with your .NET applications. With the help of the community we might get other devices working aswell.

Brematic.Net is a port of [pyPrematic](https://github.com/d-Rickyy-b/pyBrematic) (Thanks [@d-Rickyy-b](https://github.com/d-Rickyy-b) for that!) to [.NET-Standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/dotnet/standard/net-standard).
